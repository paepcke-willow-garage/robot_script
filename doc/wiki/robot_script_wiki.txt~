== API Stability ==

This package should be considered as '''stable,''' except for support of the Classic controller, which requires additional testing.

== System Dependencies ==
The package depends on the third-party cwiid wiimote bluetooth
interface. With permission of the author, Donnie Smith, cwiid is 
distributed as the ROS package `cwiid`.
##We are currently checking into integrating a working
##version into the ROS distribution. Same for the Linux Bluetooth driver. Meanwhile, ##please refer to [[wiimote/SysdepInstructions]] to ensure you use the correct cwiid ##module.

Python needs to be installed on your system. This package has been
tested under Python 2.5.2 and 2.6.5.

== Installing the wiimote Package ==

Check out the wiimote package, and `rosmake` to ready the package for
operation. Plug the Bluetooth dongle into your machine's USB port.

If you have the Motion+ Wiimote attachment, plug it into the bottom of
your Wiimote device.

Make sure your Wiimote's batteries are charged.
